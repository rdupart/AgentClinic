A few points and questions for further discussion: 1. **Seronegative MG and MuSK Antibodies:** If acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies are negative, would you recommend testing for muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies, given the presence of bulbar and neck involvement? 2. **Thymoma Screening:** For chest imaging, do you prefer CT or MRI for thymoma screening in this context? Is there any role for PET-CT if initial imaging is equivocal? 3. **Electrodiagnostic Testing:** Would you recommend single-fiber EMG in addition to repetitive nerve stimulation, especially if the latter is inconclusive? 4. **Initial Symptomatic Management:** While awaiting confirmatory tests, would you consider starting a trial of pyr"

Outpatient initiation of pyridostigmine is reasonable if there are no swallowing or respiratory issues, but admit immediately if the patient develops dysphagia, aspiration, significant dysarthria, or any signs of respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, reduced single-breath count). 2. Basic autoimmune screening (TSH, ANA) is reasonable at baseline, as thyroid disease is commonly associated with MG. 3. For steroids, I start low (e.g., prednisone 10\u201320 mg/day) and titrate up to 1 mg/kg/day to minimize risk of steroid-induced worsening, adding a steroid-sparing agent (e.g., azathioprine) early in younger patients or those with generalized disease, but may defer in mild/ocular cases. 4. Please let me know if you need patient counseling resources or guidance on monitoring for complications."

How frequently should these be performed in the initial weeks? 2. **Steroid Initiation Timing:** If the patient responds well to pyridostigmine but still has significant fatigable weakness, would you recommend starting corticosteroids promptly, or is there value in waiting to see the full effect of symptomatic therapy before initiating immunosuppression? 3. **Choice of Steroid-Sparing Agent:** In your experience, are there particular factors (e.g., age, comorbidities, antibody status) that guide your choice between azathioprine, mycophen"

For outpatient monitoring, I recommend daily single-breath counts and regular swallowing assessments (e.g., timed water swallow test), with peak expiratory flow as an adjunct; frequency should be at least daily for the first 1\u20132 weeks, increasing if symptoms worsen. 2. If significant weakness persists despite pyridostigmine, I would initiate corticosteroids without undue delay, as symptomatic therapy alone is rarely sufficient for generalized MG. 3. Choice of steroid-sparing agent depends on age, comorbidities (e.g., liver disease for azathioprine, GI issues for mycophenolate), and antibody status (MuSK-positive MG may respond better to rituximab); azathioprine is often first-line unless contraindicated."

After diagnosis and treatment initiation, follow-up is typically every 4\u20136 weeks initially, then spaced out; repeat antibody testing is not routinely needed, and clinical response (strength, fatigue, functional status) guides immunosuppression tapering. 3. Thymectomy is recommended for all patients with thymoma and for most generalized AChR-positive MG under age 60, but not for MuSK-positive or purely ocular MG; thymic hyperplasia without thymoma is a relative indication, especially in younger patients."
